# Covid-19 Data Exploration (2020-2021)
The aim of this project is to create an interactive dashboard to visualize the Covid-19 numbers across the world regards infections, deaths, and vaccinations. 
Although it is a simple project, the purpose was to get familiar with SQL queries and Tableau software. 

## Project Overview
    • Data exploration using MySQL database to answer questions regards infections, deaths, and vaccinations. 
      The Dataset was taken from Our World in Data.
    • Visualization of the queries in a dashboard using Tableau.

## Objectives

    • What are the numbers globally regards cases and deaths?
    • Which continent has been more affected? And which one has more deaths?
    • What is the percentage of death by country? How big is this percentage compared by continent? 
      And what about the infections?
